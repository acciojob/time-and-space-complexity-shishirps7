	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm. It is not going to examine the total execution time of an algorithm.It makes program efficient.</p>
